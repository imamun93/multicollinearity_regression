# Multicollinearity Regression

In my recent blog post about [Multicollinearity Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/multicollinearity-in-data-science-c5f6c0fe6edf), I discussed the effects of Multicollinearity and how to detect them.

This is just a mini project that will help show that process.

The data is from [Multicollinearity in Regression Analysis: Problems, Detection, and Solutions](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/multicollinearity-in-regression-analysis/)
